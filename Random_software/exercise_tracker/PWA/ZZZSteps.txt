Step 1: Prepare Your Project Structure

my-pwa/
│
├── index.html
├── manifest.json       ← Will create
├── service-worker.js   ← Will create
└── (optional) assets/


✅ Step 2: Create manifest.json
Create a new file called manifest.json in the same folder as your index.html.

manifest.json should have the below
{
  "name": "My PWA App",
  "short_name": "PWA App",
  "start_url": "./index.html",
  "display": "standalone",
  "background_color": "#ffffff",
  "theme_color": "#ffffff",
  "icons": [
    {
      "src": "icon-192.png",
      "sizes": "192x192",
      "type": "image/png"
    },
    {
      "src": "icon-512.png",
      "sizes": "512x512",
      "type": "image/png"
    }
  ]
}


📌 Add two icon files: icon-192.png and icon-512.png to your project directory.



✅ Step 3: Create service-worker.js
This file caches your site for offline usage.

service-worker.js should have the below
const CACHE_NAME = "my-pwa-cache-v1";
const urlsToCache = [
  "/",
  "/index.html"
  // Add CSS/JS files here if not inline
];

self.addEventListener("install", (event) => {
  event.waitUntil(
    caches.open(CACHE_NAME)
      .then((cache) => cache.addAll(urlsToCache))
  );
});

self.addEventListener("fetch", (event) => {
  event.respondWith(
    caches.match(event.request)
      .then((response) => response || fetch(event.request))
  );
});



✅ Step 4: Update index.html to Link Manifest and Register Service Worker
In the <head> of your index.html, add:

<link rel="manifest" href="manifest.json">
<meta name="theme-color" content="#ffffff">

At the bottom of <body>, just before </body>, add:

<script>
  if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
    navigator.serviceWorker.register('service-worker.js')
      .then(() => console.log('Service Worker registered'));
  }
</script>



✅ Step 5: Start a Local Server
Your PWA must be served via HTTP/HTTPS, not file://.

If you have Python installed:
python3 -m http.server 8000  # Run this in the same folder where you have your index.html file



✅ Step 6: Access on Mobile
Option 1: Same Network
Find your local IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.5).

On mobile, visit http://192.168.1.5:8000 in Chrome.

You’ll see the Add to Home screen prompt or manually use the browser menu to install the PWA. 
The above does not work. What must be done is host this on a platform that provides this via https:// and then add as a PWA.

Upload these files to a github repo and then

Go to your repo: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/my-pwa-app

Click on the Settings tab

In the left sidebar, click Pages (under "Code and automation")

Under "Source", select:

Branch: main

Folder: / (root)

Click Save

📢 GitHub will give you a public URL like:

https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/my-pwa-app/

After installing the PWA, unpublish it so that it is not accessible anymore.
