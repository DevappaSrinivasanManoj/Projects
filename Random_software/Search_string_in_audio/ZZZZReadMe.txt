I tried the above but the installation failed. So, keeping it for later trials. The goal is a voice clone.
I record something in my voice and feed it and then type something and get that something in my voice.


This again is for a search in a audio file. I type something to search in an audio file the program does the below

First clones the voice based on audio input given
Next gets the voice for the input string I have given
Then uses that to search the phrase using something called KWS (keyword search? check later in chatgpt)
