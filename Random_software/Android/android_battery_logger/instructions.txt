I want you to generate a complete Android project in Java with Gradle, ready to build on Windows. The app is called "android_battery_logger" and should have the following specifications:

1. **Target Devices & SDK**
   - Target modern Android devices (Android 12â€“14).
   - minSdkVersion = 31, compileSdkVersion = 36, targetSdkVersion = 36.
   - Build tools version: 36.1.0.

2. **Functionality**
   - Logs the device battery percentage **once per day** at a user-configurable time.
   - Tracks **charger plugged in and unplugged events**.
   - Writes all logs to a **single file** `battery_log.txt` inside a **main-level folder** called `BatteryLogs` (same parent as Downloads/Documents/DCIM).
   - Format of logs:

     ```
     Battery percentage at 21 Sep 2025 23:00 : 76%
     Charger plugged in at 22 Sep 2025 08:00, percentage when plugged in : 75%
     Charger plugged out at 22 Sep 2025 09:00, percentage when plugged out : 95%
     ```

   - Include a **pause/resume logging button** in the app.
   - Include a **time picker** so the user can configure the daily logging time.

3. **UI**
   - Minimal, lightweight, only two elements: pause/resume button and daily log time picker.

4. **Files**
   - Provide all necessary files:
     - Root `build.gradle` and `settings.gradle`
     - App `build.gradle`
     - `AndroidManifest.xml`
     - `MainActivity.java`, `BatteryReceiver.java`, `DailyLogger.java`
     - Layout XML (`activity_main.xml`)
     - Gradle wrapper files (or instructions to generate them).

5. **Build Instructions**
   - Include instructions for **Windows** to generate the Gradle wrapper if missing and build the APK:

     ```
     gradle wrapper --gradle-version 9.6
     gradlew.bat :app:assembleDebug
     ```

   - Ensure compatibility with **Java 25** and Gradle 9.6.

6. **Other Requirements**
   - Logs must be appended if the file exists.
   - Folder `BatteryLogs` should be created automatically if missing.
   - App should be lightweight and fast, no extra UI elements.
   - Provide a **ready-to-run ZIP structure**, or detailed instructions to create one.
   - Ensure all dependencies, Gradle versions, and file paths are correct so the APK can be built without errors on Windows.
