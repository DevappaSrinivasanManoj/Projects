   1. Storage Permission: The app needs WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission to save logs in a main-level folder. Modern Android versions restrict direct external storage access. Are you okay
      with the app requesting this permission, which the user must grant manually? Or would you prefer using the app-specific directory (no special permissions needed, but harder for users
      to access)? : yes, ask the user for permission which the user can grant


   2. Background Execution: To log the battery at a set time, I'll use WorkManager, the standard for background tasks on modern Android. Is this acceptable? yes


   3. UI Design: For the "minimal, lightweight" UI, I'll create a single screen with a pause/resume toggle and a time picker. Does this match your vision? : yes


   4. Charger Events: I'll use a BroadcastReceiver registered in AndroidManifest.xml to track charger events. Is this approach okay?: I am not aware of this. Use the best approach


   5. Project Delivery: The instructions mention a "ready-to-run ZIP structure." I can create the complete directory structure and all necessary files, but I cannot create a ZIP file myself.
      You would need to zip the final directory. Is this what you intended? : I just need a project using which I can build an apk file to test on android devices


   6. SDK/Build Tools: The specified compileSdkVersion (36) and buildToolsVersion (36.1.0) are future versions. To ensure stability, I'll use the latest stable versions (compileSdkVersion =
      34 and a recent build tools version). Is this acceptable?  : yes, you may also check the versions installed and make the decision


   7. Java/Gradle Versions: The requested Java (25) and Gradle (9.6) versions are not yet released. I will configure the project to use the current standards, Java 17 and Gradle 8.7. Is this
      okay? : yes, you may also check the versions installed and make the decision
