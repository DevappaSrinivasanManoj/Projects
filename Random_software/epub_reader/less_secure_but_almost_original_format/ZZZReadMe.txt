This is more of a visually appealing reader which keeps the original style but still removes links images etc.
The removal doesn't happen in the reader, so this reader can actually be used for reading an actual epub without any change
too. The removal of links, images etc happens in the code that is present in the lib.ipynb file.
Sanitize the epub file using that code and read with this reader for security.
