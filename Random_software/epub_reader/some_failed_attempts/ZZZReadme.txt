Here I tried to keep the secureness and the source format. This was because I wanted to read a book that was confusing if read without format
But this did not work easily. So, I gave it up to save time.

But then I left everything else and created this! Again by splitting the tasks

I created a reader which just reads as is. And then I created a python script that removes dangerous tags but tries its best to keep the 
source format. 

This is available in the folder named less_secure_but_almost_original_format, this is present in the main folder.

But I spent the full day here instead of doing other required tasks!!
