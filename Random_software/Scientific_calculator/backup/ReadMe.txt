To continue with button formatting. to ask for the comma button to be on the top along with the functions itself. And to make sure the numbers
buttons are not touched.

And continue with decimal to fraction conversion button.

I decided to use python now to create a calculator instead of html+css+js. Python with ipywidgets to run the calculator on colab or
Jupyter notebook.

Even this is so hard!! Thinking of giving up!!

Decided to have a simple python program with no UI. This way I will have the power and not have to worry about the display.


Got a hack and succeeded with it finally. I decided to break the functionalities and have it in separate UIs instead of all in one. Now I have this as a super colab/ipynb file which has all the functionalities that are needed. Maybe in separate pieces of UI, but in a single colab sheet. Feeling proud. The message is to never give up.
