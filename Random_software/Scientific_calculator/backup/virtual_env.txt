The below only if not already present. This is required for creating virtual envs
sudo apt install python3.10-venv

Create the Virtual Environment:
python -m venv ScientificCalc
python3 -m venv ScientificCalc

Activate the Virtual Environment: (This can also be used when you need to activate the env the subsequent times)
source ScientificCalc/bin/activate

Install Libraries with Specific Versions:
pip install scipy

Verify Installed Libraries:
pip list

Below command to export the requirements(i.e. all the libraries installed to run this API in the created virtual env) to a file named requirements.txt. This file can later be used in the cloud server to create a similar virtual environment.
pip freeze >  requirements.txt

Closing the terminal deactivates the virtual env automatically. But still you can use deactivate command to deactivate it.
deactivate
