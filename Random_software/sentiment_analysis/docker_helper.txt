To pull the image
docker pull python:3.11-slim


1. Start the Docker container:


docker run -it --rm -p 5000:5000 -v "%cd%":/app -w /app python:3.11-slim bash

This opens the terminal of the container right in the cmd window, in that do the below.

2. Inside the container, install the dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Run the API:

python3 app.py


The API will then be available at http://localhost:5000.

Here's how you can interact with the endpoints:


Use the below curl in postman

curl --location 'http://localhost:5000/predict' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "comments": [
        "This is amazing",
        "This is bad",
        "This is not so good"
    ]
}
'


Till above for just running it. Now we have to deploy a prod version, so do the below

pip install gunicorn (Not needed second time as this is added in requirements.txt)

This runs the prod server

gunicorn --workers 4 --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 app:app

After this, the same curl as above works here.

Have deployed the API in render server
https://render.com/

Below is the curl for the API

curl --location 'https://sentiment-analysis-api-x13f.onrender.com/predict' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "comments": [
        "This is amazing",
        "This is bad",
        "This is not so good",
        "I love this",
        "I like this"
    ]
}
'


Below is the curl from the gateway of RapidAPI.

curl --location 'https://sentiment_analysis6.p.rapidapi.com/predict' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'x-rapidapi-key: 27c6272b78msh294c9b43f2e2ff3p194cc0jsn8eeabace6d7c' \
--data '{"comments":["This is amazing","This is bad"]}'
