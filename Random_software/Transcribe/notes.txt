Whisper offers different models for transcription:

tiny: Fast, lower accuracy.
base: Balanced speed and accuracy.
small: More accurate, slower.
medium: Highly accurate, slower.
large: Best accuracy, very slow.
You can specify the model by replacing "base" in the code or command above.


Whisper Library Notes
Purpose: Whisper is an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system developed by OpenAI. It is used to transcribe audio files (e.g., speech in videos, podcasts, meetings) into text.

Main Features:

Supports multiple languages.
Works with various audio formats (.mp3, .wav, .flac, etc.).
Provides pre-trained models of varying sizes (tiny, base, medium, large) for different transcription speeds and accuracy.
Key Use Cases:

Transcribing audio from video files.
Converting recorded speech into written text.
Supporting multi-language transcription.
Model Sizes:

tiny: Smallest model, faster but less accurate.
base: Moderate speed and accuracy.
medium: Balanced performance.
large: Most accurate but slower.
Installation:

bash
Copy code
pip install openai-whisper
Basic Usage:

python
Copy code
import whisper
model = whisper.load_model("base")
result = model.transcribe("audio_file_path")
print(result["text"])
Input Types: Works with audio files (e.g., .mp3, .wav, .flac, etc.).
