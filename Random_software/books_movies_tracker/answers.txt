* Besides the status, what other information should we store for each book? For example, should we include title, author, genre,
your personal rating (e.g., 1-5 stars), and the date you finished it? Yes, have the title of the book, which I will type manually, and also the author name and rating and the date I finished(the date must be automatically captured from the system and not be entered manually). I do not need the genre.


* Similarly for movies, what details should we store? I'm thinking title, director, genre, release year, your personal rating,
and the date you watched it. Is there anything else you'd like to add? Yes, have the title, director and personal rating and the date which is captured automatically

* Can you tell me more about the "retro feel" you're imagining? Are you thinking of a specific style, like an 8-bit or pixel art
         aesthetic, the look of an old operating system like Windows 95, or something else? : Nothing as such, it has to be clear and cool, but has to be like that cool website which was in the past and making people wonder how could someone have cretaed such a thing in the past. 
		 

 * You mentioned counting movies by the year they were watched. Would you also like to be able to filter your list of movies to
         see only the ones you watched in a specific year? : Yes, this ust be there. By default it has to be like I can keep scrolling to see the list watched by me in descending order, i.e. the latest movies on top and older movies in the bottom, but I must have the option to filter by year and director and rating. Also, if I search for a movie name it must show that movie and the date I have watched along with the rating.
		 

 * How do you envision adding new books and movies to your lists? I'm thinking of a simple form where you can manually type in
         the details for each item. Does that sound right? Yes, I type the name and author/director and enter my rating by clicking on the start, not manually typing the stars.

 * When you first open the app, what would you prefer to see? A dashboard with a summary (e.g., "You've read 5 books and watched
         12 movies this year"), or a list of your books or movies? : This is upto you, make it creative and give me the wow feeling
		 


* Besides filtering movies by year, would you like to have options to sort or search your book and movie lists? For example,
         sorting by title, author/director, or your rating. : Yes, I must be able to filter by rating, author/director and year. Sorting is not something I would need, filtering is my main need.
		 
 * For the import and export feature, I would recommend using a standard JSON file. This format is human-readable and easily
         transferable. Is that acceptable to you? : yes, this is fine by me.
		 

Also, make sure to have the movie count and book count separate. Do not jumble and club these 2. I know you will do this, but jsut letting you know.
